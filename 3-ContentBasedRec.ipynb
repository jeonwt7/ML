The system will make recommendations which are similar in content to a given query, which can be stated preferences or a sample movie. The main description of content in the MovieLens dataset is the genres label. For now, we will work with these discrete labels rather than natural language documents; but even in this simplified setting, you will see how tf-idf can make better recommendations than a naive bag of words approach. \n","\n","We have written most of the skeleton code for you.
